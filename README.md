# CodeThing (`t3`: Node + WebSocket + Browser)

CodeThing now runs as a local Node.js runtime that serves a browser UI and exposes a local WebSocket API.

Current implementation is:

1. Codex-first: connects to `codex app-server` and streams turn/item events.
2. Provider-ready: renderer speaks a provider abstraction so Claude Code can plug in later.
3. Typed end-to-end: contracts validate payloads across the WebSocket boundary.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx t3
```

On launch, `t3`:

1. starts a local WebSocket runtime (`127.0.0.1`),
2. serves the web UI in your browser,
3. auto-connects to your current working directory as the default project.

CLI flags:

- `--no-open[=bool]` — disable browser auto-open (supports `true/false`, `1/0`, `yes/no`, `on/off` in equals form).
- `--backend-port <port>` — set WebSocket runtime port.
- `--web-port <port>` — set web UI port.
- `--cwd <path>` — choose launch project directory (defaults to current directory).
- `<path>` — shorthand positional argument equivalent to `--cwd <path>`.
- `-- <path>` — treat following argument as path even if it starts with `-`.
- `--version` — print CLI version.
- `--help` — print CLI usage.

`--cwd` (or positional path) must point to an existing directory; startup fails fast with a clear error otherwise.

If default ports are busy, `t3` will automatically retry with the next available port pair unless ports are explicitly pinned via CLI flags or environment variables.

Optional environment variables:

- `T3_NO_OPEN=1` — start runtime without auto-opening a browser window (also accepts `true`, `yes`, or `on`).
- `T3_BACKEND_PORT` — override local WebSocket runtime port (default `4317`).
- `T3_WEB_PORT` — override local web UI port (default `4318`).

Runtime command semantics:

- `terminal.run` executes in the launch directory when `cwd` is omitted.
- Relative `cwd` values for `terminal.run` and `shell.openInEditor` resolve from the launch directory.
- `terminal.run` and `shell.openInEditor` reject missing/non-directory cwd targets with structured request errors.

## Workspace layout

- `/apps/t3`: CLI launcher + local WebSocket runtime server.
- `/apps/desktop`: Runtime internals used by `t3` (no Electron app shell).
- `/apps/renderer`: React + Vite UI for session control, conversation, and protocol event stream.
- `/packages/contracts`: shared Zod schemas + TypeScript types for WS protocol, provider events, and API contracts.

## Codex prerequisites

- Install Codex CLI so `codex` is on your PATH.
- Authenticate Codex before running CodeThing (for example via API key or ChatGPT auth supported by Codex).
- CodeThing starts the server via `codex app-server` per session.

## Runtime boundary model

- `t3` starts a localhost-only WebSocket server.
- Launch URLs include an ephemeral WebSocket token so only the opened browser session can attach.
- Connections missing the token (or using a wrong token) are rejected by the runtime.
- Browser renderer talks through a typed `NativeApi` adapter over that WebSocket.
- Runtime currently enforces a single active browser client (new client replaces old one).
- Runtime validates request payloads with shared Zod contracts.
- Codex execution sandbox policy (`read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`) is still selected per session startup options.
- Static HTML responses are served with `Cache-Control: no-store`; built `/assets/*` files are served with long-lived immutable cache headers.

## Runtime modes

CodeThing has a global runtime mode switch in the sidebar:

- `Full access` (default): starts new sessions with `approvalPolicy: never` and `sandboxMode: danger-full-access`.
- `Approval required`: starts new sessions with `approvalPolicy: on-request` and `sandboxMode: workspace-write`, then prompts in-app for command/file approvals.

Mode changes apply across all threads. Existing live sessions are restarted so old and new threads use the selected mode.

## Scripts

- `bun run dev`: builds contracts, starts `t3` runtime, opens browser UI.
- `bun run build`: builds contracts, renderer static assets, and `t3` CLI bundle.
- `bun run typecheck`: strict TypeScript checks for all packages.
- `bun run test`: runs workspace tests.
- `bun run --cwd apps/t3 dev`: run the CLI directly in dev mode.

## Provider architecture

The renderer depends on `nativeApi.providers.*`:

1. `startSession`
2. `sendTurn`
3. `interruptTurn`
4. `respondToRequest`
5. `stopSession`
6. `listSessions`
7. `onEvent`

Codex is the only implemented provider right now. `claudeCode` is reserved in contracts/UI but currently returns a not-implemented runtime error.

Runtime app utilities exposed via `nativeApi.app.*`:

1. `bootstrap`
2. `health`
